            <p>Lets look at a typical scenario here of a standard nigerian relationship, Tolu is a nigerian graduate of mechanical engineering from ahmadu bello university, leaving in a one room apartment in orile,  lagos. currently teaching in a primary school,  but is optimistic whatsoever about landing a better job,  he has a girlfriend Rose, who no 1 is dating him without her parents knowledge,  and 2. refuses to enter the university(maybe to remain in close proximity to the love of her lifeðŸ™„),  for reasons best known to her. and decides to find a blue collar job, their relationship is as good as it can be,  as they share intimacy, companionship,  and optimistic ambitions,  with rose's own obscenely grandeur,  but no visible sign of trying to achieve them..  she exhibits a fierce jealousy,  and is extremely protective of here boyfriend,  cooks for him(with her money), washes his clothes,  gives him mind blowing sex,  and even agrees to sex positions she ais not comfortable in,  all poised towards keeping in place this individual she calls her man. forward five years after the relationship,  Tolu gets a job in an MNC,  and promptly leaves her after one year,  
                This is a typical anecdote in the way most relationships end,  and its now so trite that nobody is impressed again by the tale, (well except the ladies affected, they are usually progenitors of this tales,  although they try to inflate their "supposed importance" in the guys life) 
                so why do this guy leave them,  when "apparently", they were the pillar of those guys life, it all comes down to one thing
                NO AMBITION
                Not to mince words, this is the biggest reason why men leave their women once they find their way out of their austere way of living.
                in the scenario above, we see rose,  who is dating a graduate,  but refuses to go to school?!!
                what does she expect the guy to do?,  marry an illiterate?,  sweet but unlikely..  i know a lot of ladies would protest this,  but i have seen guys that have been dumped by their educated girlfriends(the biggest mistakes that would make your girlfriend leave you-link), because they were illiterates, although this is not really common.
                maybe she felt that she was cooking for him,  giving him mind blowing sex,  and was credulous enough to believe that his love for her would cover her deficiencies,  but no, those deficiencies are, very vivid
                1. she made no attempt to go to school,  and polish herself
                2. she did not even attempt to learn a skill,  preferring to go and get a blue collar job, 
                3. made no reasonable addition to his life, N.B any girl can cook and give an guy sex, but few girls can advice a guy, on critical positions to take and bring up ideas that would be useful to the guy in terms of aiding his career or business 
                so ladies here u have it,  even if you are in a relationship with a guy,  make sure u are improving yourself in every area, working hand in hand with him of course to achieve some necessary common goals. Because as much as we would want to deny, call me Cynical, nobody likes a dead weight.
